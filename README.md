# IdentiFly

## Scope
For anyone running a small to medium business, finding the right manufacturer, contractor, logistics partner, IT partner - the list goes on- has always been difficult. These folks rely on word-of-mouth recommendations, incomplete online resources or cold-calls. It's also extremely difficult to verify the credibility or reliability due to the lack of transparency.

With IdentiFly, customers will be able to post a request and have vendors come to them. They will be able to compare the costs and benefits of choosing a particular partner. This will be the online marketplace for small to medium businesses to identify partners they need, on the fly.
